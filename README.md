# HTML Practice

This repository contains the HTML code I practiced while learning from **Complete Coding by Prashant Sir** on YouTube.

It includes examples of basic tags, semantic elements, forms, lists, tables, and a simple contact form project.

## Folders

- Level-1 to Level-5: Practice files for different HTML topics
- Forms: Input tags, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
- Mini Projects: Contact form, image layouts
- Assets: Sample images used in the pages

## Note

This helped me a lot in understanding HTML basics.  
Itâ€™s a pure learning-based project and will evolve as I keep growing in frontend development.
